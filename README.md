# Predicting_Formula_1_Races_using_ANN#

This is a repository for the code and models used in the project "Predicting the outcome of Formula 1 races using Machine learning models and Data Analysis Tools"

They edited and wrote a lot of the code in this repository

In the Scripts folder the file "Variables.ipynb" creates a dataframe and a CSV file of all variables used in the model

Script "F1_baseline_model2.ipynb" creates a static ANN Model

Script "Dynamic_model_baseline" created the dynamic ANN Model

Script "Dynamic_Model_Testing" is used to test the accuracy of the model with different variables enabled

Lastly,
Script "F1_playground_start" is used as intital testing space but also data transformation

All generated prediction Graphs can be seen in Folder "Outputs"
